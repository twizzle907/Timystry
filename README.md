Timystry Vision Statement:

For students who want to stay on top of assignments or who need assistance with organization and motivation, the Timystry Android Application is a time allocation and planning system that will help students stay organized and on top of their assignments or provide motivation and time management assistance to the unorganized student.  This application will allow the student to enter in assignments, due dates, and time estimations, as well as hours of availability for homework.  Reminders and time allotments will help the student visually understand when assignments need to be attended to.  Color coding and notifications will remind students of looming deadlines.  Unlike currently available applications, this product will put everything in one place for the student and provide visual feedback and reminders for tasks.
